# Anonymous Cultural Crowdfunding

A privacy-preserving crowdfunding platform for cultural projects built on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) technology. This decentralized application enables creators to raise funds for cultural initiatives while maintaining complete anonymity for both project creators and contributors.

## üåü Overview

Anonymous Cultural Crowdfunding revolutionizes the way cultural projects are funded by leveraging cutting-edge FHE smart contracts. The platform ensures that contribution amounts remain encrypted on-chain, protecting the privacy of backers while maintaining full transparency of project operations.

## üîê Core Concepts

### Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE)

This platform utilizes FHE technology to enable computations on encrypted data without ever decrypting it. This means:

- **Private Contributions**: Donation amounts are encrypted end-to-end, visible only to the contributor
- **Confidential Fundraising**: Project funding progress is calculated on encrypted values
- **Anonymous Backing**: Contributors can support projects without revealing their identity or contribution amount publicly
- **Trustless Privacy**: No central authority can access private contribution data

### Privacy-First Architecture

The platform implements a zero-knowledge architecture where:
- Contribution amounts are encrypted using FHE before being recorded on-chain
- Smart contracts perform calculations on encrypted values without decryption
- Only authorized parties (the contributor themselves) can decrypt their contribution amounts
- Project creators receive funds without knowing individual contribution amounts

### Cultural Project Categories

Support diverse cultural initiatives across multiple categories:
- üé® Visual Arts
- üéµ Music
- üìö Literature
- üé¨ Film & Cinema
- üé≠ Theater & Performance
- üíÉ Dance
- üñ•Ô∏è Digital Art
- üì∏ Photography
- üè∫ Traditional Crafts
- üèõÔ∏è Community Cultural Heritage

## üí° How It Works

### Creating a Project

1. Connect your Web3 wallet to the platform
2. Navigate to the "Create Project" tab
3. Fill in project details:
   - Project title and description
   - Cultural category
   - Funding target (in ETH)
   - Campaign duration
   - Optional IPFS metadata hash for additional materials
4. Submit transaction to create your project on-chain

### Contributing to Projects

1. Browse active cultural projects
2. Select a project you wish to support
3. Enter contribution amount (encrypted automatically)
4. Optionally add an anonymous support message
5. Confirm transaction to submit your encrypted contribution

### Project Finalization

- Projects automatically finalize when the funding period expires
- FHE smart contract verifies if encrypted funding goal was met
- Successful projects: Creators can withdraw funds
- Unsuccessful projects: Contributors can claim automatic refunds
